# Procedure

To run the `zfnet.ipynb` file follow these instructions:
* Download the dataset from [Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
* Copy and paste the path of the train, test, and val folders into the `zfnet.ipynb` file. 
* If using Google Colab, the Google Drive Mount cell may be used to import the files from Drive.
* Simply run each cell sequentially to receive results.

To load the trained ZFnet model our report and presentation was based on, please complete the above steps, then:
* Download the model from [here](https://csulb-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yoosuf_batliwala_student_csulb_edu/Esn2WziocZ1GhXRmPWvFv2sB6aN4GQZycwr-ppA-bavpAQ?e=rS9Kzj).
* In `zfnet.ipynb`, scroll down to the cell containing the comment header `Save the model, if desired`.
* Uncomment the two lines of code below the header and replace the existing string with the path of the saved model on your local directory.
* Run the cell.
* This should allow you to see the results of the model we based our report and presentation on.

If any errors occur, please contact me at `yoosuf.batliwala@student.csulb.edu` and I will try to resolve them.
